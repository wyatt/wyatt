## About 🙂
Hey, I'm Wyatt! 👋 I'm a programmer and student who enjoys making cool stuff using technology. I've got a [blog](https://medium.com/wyattsell) which I'm working on, where you'll find me talking about projects I've done and things I find interesting. Currently I'm trying to learn more about hardware and eletronics but software is where I'm most familiar. Below you can see the tools and languages I have experience with and the ones I want to learn. Oh also... I'm available to hire for web development! Get in touch with one of the links below.
