## About 🙂
Hey I'm Wyatt 👋 I'm a programmer and student who enjoys making cool stuff using technology. I'm a massive productivity nerd, and I've released my own revision app called [Revisio](https://revisio.app). I love tinkering with electronics, and learning new things - here's my [blog](https://wyattsell.blog) where I document my various projects and inventions.

## Tools I want to learn
- 💡 Electrical wiring - I'd love to know more about circuits so I can feel more confident in messing with hardware.
- 🐦 Swift - I've never built a mobile app, and Swift seems a good place to start.
- ⚙ Machine learning - I know zero about machine learning, and it seems to be full of endless possibilities.
